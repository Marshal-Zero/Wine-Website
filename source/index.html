            <p>We deliver the best wine to best customers so we treat wine as living product that requires special care...We transport the bottles upright to avoid leakage and avoid transporting wine in excessively hot or cold conditions. Since
                wine is disturbed by transportation vibration and movement; let it rest 2 to 3 weeks after arrival.</p>
